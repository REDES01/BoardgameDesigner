user: can you provide the functions you can use
assistant: I have access to the following functions:

1. `Players-create_player`: This function creates a new player that can play a game and provide feedback. It requires a `name` parameter, which is a string.

2. `Players-find_player`: This function checks if a player with a certain name exists. It also requires a `name` parameter, which is a string.

Additionally, I can use the `multi_tool_use.parallel` function to execute multiple functions simultaneously if they can operate in parallel.
